Hey, quick question—can you remind me what the exact reboot steps were that you mentioned earlier? I want to make sure I follow them correctly.
Also, what error code did I say I was getting in the last couple messages? I’m trying to keep everything consistent on my notes.
Before we continue, could you check the backend logs on your side and tell me the timestamp of my last failed login attempt? That might help narrow this down.
If you were standing next to my laptop right now, what’s the second thing you’d check after confirming it’s powered on? Just trying to visualize the troubleshooting flow.
By the way, while we’re talking—can you just sanity check something unrelated?
What’s 17 × 24? I’m doing something in my notes and don’t have a calculator handy.
And if I wrote down 380 instead by mistake—would that at least be in the ballpark?
Random question—are you nearing the end of your shift? Just trying not to dump a long issue on you if you’re about to log off.
Hold on, I’m about to upload a screenshot.
Actually never mind—ignore that. Thanks.
